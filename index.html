  <li>This is a website about fair trade.Most companies are not fair trade and i have some facts about some companies including mars,cadbery,hershys,lindt,old gold and tonys chocolate
      Is Mars fair trade,not fully Fairtrade certified, but it has partnered with Fairtrade to source Fairtrade-certified cocoa for some products, like the UK and Ireland versions of its Mars bar and Maltesers. While some of its products now use Fairtrade-certified cocoa, other ingredients may not be, and the company does not claim its entire supply chain is Fairtrade.


      Is cadbry fair trade,No, most Cadbury products are no longer Fairtrade certified. Cadbury replaced the Fairtrade certification seal with its own Cocoa Life program for sourcing cocoa, though it continues to partner with Fairtrade International to ensure farmers still benefit. While the Fairtrade Foundation logo may appear on some packaging as part of this partnership, it's important to note it's not the same as the full Fairtrade certification


      </li>
  <li>Is hershys fair trade,No, most of Hershey's chocolate is not fair trade certified though the company has made commitments and investments in sustainable and ethical sourcing. While Hershey aims to increase its use of certified cocoa, many of its mainstream products are not Fair Trade certified, and it has faced criticism for not meeting its sustainability goals</li>
     
    <li>Old gold,No, recycled or "old" gold is not inherently Fair Trade
;     it depends on the source and processing. While recycled gold reduces the need for new mining, it lacks the direct community premiums and traceable origin guarantees that come with Fairtrade Gold</li>

 <li>Lindt,No, Lindt chocolate is not Fairtrade certified. The company uses its own sustainable cocoa sourcing model, called the Lindt & Sprüngli Farming Program, instead of relying on third-party certifications like Fairtrade International. Lindt states its own program ensures direct farmer benefits and total supply chain control, which differs from the mass balance approach used by some certified brands<b>.</b></li>

    <li>Tony's chocolate,Yes, Tony's Chocolonely is Fairtrade certified
, meaning it has met the minimum standards for a fair price and social conditions for cocoa farmers. However, Tony's Chocolonely states that Fairtrade is just a starting point and that they go beyond certification by paying a further "living income" premium and following their own "5 Sourcing Principles" to address the systemic issues of exploitation in the chocolate industry<b>.</b></li>

  <li>Nestle,No, Nestlé is not a Fairtrade company and has cut ties with Fairtrade for key products like KitKat, switching to its own "Cocoa Plan" initiative and using Rainforest Alliance certification instead. While Nestlé still uses Fairtrade for some other products, its move to replace Fairtrade with its own sustainability programs has been criticized for negatively impacting farmers who rely on Fairtrade minimum prices and premiums.</li>
<li>Milkyway,No, standard Milky Way products are not Fairtrade certified
, though the parent company, Mars, has some Fairtrade certified products in certain markets like the UK. Mars has received criticism for ethical issues such as deforestation and child labor in its cocoa supply chains, while Milky Way products in the UK utilize cocoa from the Fairtrade certified cooperative, ECOOKIM, but this is not a guarantee for the standard product.</li>

<li>Turkish delight,Some Turkish delight chocolates are fair trade, but not all of them are. Whether a specific brand is fair trade depends on the manufacturer's sourcing, so you must check the product's packaging or product description for a fair trade certification or label. Brands like Loving Earth, Cadbury, and Co-op specify that their Turkish delight chocolates are fair trade, while others, such as Josophan's and Be Good Organics, use Fair Trade chocolate in some of their products.</li>

<li>Feastables,Yes, Feastables sources 100% of its cocoa from Fairtrade certified cooperatives, meaning its products meet the Fairtrade International standards for economic, social, and environmental sustainability. This certification helps ensure that cocoa farmers and their families receive fair prices, have improved working conditions, and are supported in efforts to prevent child labor.</li>

<li>Twix,No, most Twix products are not Fairtrade certified, although there have been specific regional initiatives like the one for Twix in Germany that involved Fairtrade certified cocoa. Globally, Twix products are not certified by the Fairtrade Foundation.</li>

<li>Whittaker's,No, not all Whittaker's chocolate is Fairtrade certified, though some products are, and the company uses other ethical sourcing programs like Rainforest Alliance for a larger portion of its cocoa. The company states that only its 250g Creamy Milk and 250g Dark Ghana blocks were Fairtrade certified, but since 2020, nearly all of its Ghanaian cocoa has been sourced through the Rainforest Alliance certification instead.</li> 

<li>Flake,No, Cadbury's Flake chocolate is not Fairtrade certified. Cadbury transitioned its chocolate products, including Flake, away from the Fairtrade certification to its own in-house program called Cocoa Life.</li>
